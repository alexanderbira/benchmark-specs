# Benchmark Specifications

This is a collection of LTL and GR(1) specifications, which can be used as benchmarks for requirements engineering algorithms, such as unrealizability checking, goal conflict detection, and boundary condition generation.

Each test case is in the following JSON format:
```typescript
{
  "name": string,          // benchmark name
  "type": "GR(1)" | "LTL", // type of specification
  "ins": string[],         // input/environment variables
  "outs": string[],        // output/system variables
  "domains": string[],     // domain assumption formulae in the OWL format (https://gitlab.lrz.de/i7/owl/-/blob/main/doc/FORMATS.md)
  "goals": string[]        // goal formulae in the OWL format
}
```
